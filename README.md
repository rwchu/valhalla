<h1>Valhalla</h1>

Valhalla is a simulation of a medieval-era civilization. The simulation proceeds through multiple iterations in which new villagers are born, buildings are erected, resources are consumed, and much more. Depending on various factors, the civilization can either flourish or collapse. 

Inspired by video games such as Sid Meier's Civilization, Banished, and Cities: Skylines, this project was created mostly for fun, but also as a way of observing how different aspects of a civilization interact with each other to produce a functioning society.
